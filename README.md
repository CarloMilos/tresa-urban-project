1.1 Development of a Tailored Mapping Software:
• Design and develop customised mapping software tailored to TRESA's requirements and
the unique characteristics of Totterdown's green spaces.

1.2 Enhance Data Collection and Analysis:
• Develop a systematic approach to data collection, including the design of digital forms and
databases for efficient data capture.
• Implement analytical tools to process and analyse collected data, generating valuable
insights into green space usage patterns, environmental factors, and community
preferences.
• Incorporate features such as geospatial visualisation, interactive mapping, and data
overlay capabilities to provide comprehensive information about green space distribution
and accessibility.

1.3 Ensure User-Friendly Experience:
• Prioritise user experience in software design, focusing on intuitive interfaces, simplified
workflows, and accessible functionalities to encourage community engagement.
• Conduct user testing and feedback sessions to iteratively refine the software interface and
enhance usability based on user preferences and needs.

1.4 Facilitate Sustainable Practices:
• Integrate sustainability principles into the design and development of software features,
promoting eco-friendly behaviours and practices among community members.
• Offer resources and guidance through the software platform to support sustainable
initiatives, such as community gardening, wildlife conservation, and waste reduction
efforts
